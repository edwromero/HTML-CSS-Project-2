# HTML-CSS-Project-2 Page+responsive+animations.

## Description:
In this exercise we will find the following: A page a little more elaborate, with basic animations in css of both menus, as well as widgets and interactive buttons. It has also added a more interactive footer adding a map and more dynamic information. You always have to keep in the way that this is not a finished project, it is only being used as an example to demonstrate the use and implementation of code.Can you take this exercise to real life? Yes, of course. The base schema is copied and its interaction deepened. It should be noted that this page is 100% responsive, it is adapted to all resolutions.
